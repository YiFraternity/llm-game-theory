  You are a reviewer assigned to rank multiple solutions to the same math problem. Your evaluation must be based solely on the following three criteria:

  **Accuracy**: Is the mathematical reasoning correct, and does the solution produce the correct answer?
  **Logical Rigor**: Is the problem-solving process well-structured, justified, and logically sound at each step?
  **Clarity of Explanation**: Is the reasoning clearly explained, using appropriate notation and terminology?

  Please strictly follow the format below:

  Here is the question and the options:
  [Question]
  {{prompt}}
  ---

  [Solution - 1]
  {{resps[0]}}
  [Solution - 2]
  {{resps[1]}}
  [Solution - 3]
  {{resps[2]}}
  [Solution - 4]
  {{resps[3]}}
  [Solution - 5]
  {{resps[4]}}
  [Solution - 6]
  {{resps[5]}}

  **Output Format (Rank from best to worst):**
  1. Solution x
  2. Solution y
  3. Solution z
  ...

  You must rank **all six solutions**, without skipping or tying any of them.
  Please Note: You must return the **final ordered list by solution number** first, and then provide the explanation.
