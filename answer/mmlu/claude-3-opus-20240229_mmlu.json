Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom.

A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

The buyer defaulted on the contract by telling the seller she could no longer purchase the house due to losing her job. She asked for the earnest money back.\n\n4. The seller told the buyer that his actual losses exceeded the earnest money amount, and that if he sued, he would receive at least $5,000 in damages. He also said it would be difficult to sell the house in the current market.\n\n5. In general, earnest money acts as a form of liquidated damages if the buyer defaults, to compensate the seller. Unless the contract specifies otherwise, the seller is typically entitled to keep the earnest money if the buyer defaults.\n\n6. The fact that the contract was silent on remedies does not mean the buyer gets the earnest money back. On the contrary, it means standard contract law principles apply, which allow the seller to keep the earnest money as compensation for the buyer's breach. So (A) is incorrect.\n\n7. The seller's actual losses exceeding the earnest money amount further justifies the seller keeping the earnest money, so (B) is correct. The buyer's change in circumstances and inability to close the deal is not a valid reason to demand the earnest money back, so (C) and (D) are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (B) - the buyer should not get the earnest money back because the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money.",

Greenwood (1988), the Supreme Court held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home. The Court reasoned that garbage left at the curb is readily accessible to the public.\n\n3. The key question is whether the alley behind the man's house where the garbage cans were located is considered within the curtilage of his home. Curtilage is the area immediately surrounding a house that harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of the home.\n\n4. The facts state that the alley was a public thoroughfare maintained by the city. This suggests the alley was not within the curtilage of the man's home, but rather was a public space.\n\n5.

Bush's presidency (1989-1993):\n\n- Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev declared a U.S.-Soviet strategic partnership at the summit of July 1991, decisively marking the end of the Cold War.\n\n- After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Bush and Gorbachev's successor Boris Yeltsin continued the bilateral partnership.\n\n- However, Bush was criticized for his uncertain response to the Baltic states' independence movement and the Soviet coup attempt of 1991. Some felt he could have been more assertive in supporting democratization.\n\nSo in summary, Bush provided general support to Gorbachev and Yeltsin as the Soviet Union dissolved, but was somewhat cautious and hesitant at times. \n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be (A) Cautious support for Gorbachev and Yeltsin.",

        "resp": "Let's think through this step-by-step and refer to reliable sources on virology to determine the correct answer.\n\nArenaviruses are a family of viruses that includes several human pathogens, such as the viruses causing Lassa fever and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Diagnosis of arenavirus infections can be challenging.\n\nA few key points about arenavirus diagnosis:\n\n1. Travel history and living in an endemic area can raise suspicion of an arenavirus infection, but alone are not sufficient for definitive diagnosis. More specific testing is needed.\n\n2. Cell culture can be used to isolate arenaviruses, but requires high biosafety level (BSL-4) facilities due to the dangerous nature of some arenaviruses. It is not routinely available.\n\n3. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) can detect arenavirus RNA and is an important diagnostic tool. However, a kit alone is not sufficient without the rest of the testing process.\n\n4. Immunological tests to detect antibodies against arenaviruses or viral antigens are important for diagnosis, especially since the viremic stage may be short.\n\nConsidering these factors, while all the listed elements can contribute to diagnosis, the most essential component that allows specific confirmation of an arenavirus infection appears to be (D) immunological testing. \n\nClinical suspicion based on history guides the decision to test, but cannot confirm a diagnosis alone. Cell culture and RT-PCR provide direct evidence of the virus but have limitations in availability and timing. Immunological tests demonstrating the host's response to the virus are critical for definitive diagnosis in most cases.\n\nTherefore, the best answer appears to be (D) Immuno test.
