Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

The sickle cell trait provides partial protection against malaria, which means heterozygotes are more likely to survive and reproduce in malaria-endemic regions.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as heterozygote advantage or balanced polymorphism.

Drought: The Southwest experienced significant climate changes during the Mogollon period, with prolonged periods of drought that would have made agricultural sustainability difficult.\n\n2.

Based on historical sociological research about migration and race relations in post-war Britain, Patterson's study likely found evidence supporting multiple aspects of racial tension and economic challenges.\n\n5. The statement \"all of the above\" suggests that the study found:\n   - Economic competition between racial groups\n   - Spatial concentration of migrants in disadvantaged housing\n   - Racial tensions and resentment from white communities\n\n6.

Concepts like security are not fixed or natural, but are constructed through human interactions and shared interpretations\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) This option directly captures the key idea of social constructivism - that human actors construct their understanding of the world, including security. It suggests that social realities are not predetermined but created through human interaction and interpretation.\n\n(B) This is too narrow. Social constructivism is not limited to societal sphere issues like poverty or race relations.\n\n(C) This option suggests constructivism studies \"natural\" systems, which contradicts its core premise that systems are not natural but constructed.\n\n(D) While social constructivism does have diverse interpretations, it is not so amorphous that it eludes definition.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (A): Social constructivism argues that security can be constructed, and that the human world is not given or natural but instead is a product of human actors.\n\nThe answer is (A).",
