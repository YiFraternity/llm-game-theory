If one of the four brushes is damaged, it effectively removes one of the parallel paths for current flow. \n\n1. **Voltage (V):** The voltage generated by the machine is determined by the speed of rotation and the magnetic field, and it is not directly affected by the number of brushes. Therefore, the voltage remains the same.\n\n2. **Current (I):** With one brush damaged, the number of parallel paths for current is reduced. In a lap winding, the current is divided among the brushes. With one brush out, the current capacity is reduced, effectively halving the current capacity of the machine.\n\n3. **Power (P):** Power is the product of voltage and current (P = V * I).

It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

Cavour used diplomatic and political strategies to achieve unification, including alliances and strategic warfare.\n\nFreeman's critique seems to focus on the rapid and thorough nature of Italian unification, particularly the loss of regional identities like that of Sicily.

        "resp": "When initializing the weight vector in a fully connected neural network, setting all weights to zero is generally not recommended. This is because if all weights are initialized to the same value, especially zero, it can lead to symmetry problems. Specifically, if all neurons in a layer start with the same weights, they will compute the same gradients during backpropagation and thus update in the same way. This means that all neurons will continue to behave identically, which prevents the network from learning effectively.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) \"Should not set it to zero since otherwise it will cause overfitting\" - This is incorrect. Setting weights to zero does not directly cause overfitting; overfitting is more related to the model's capacity and the amount of training data.\n\n(B) \"Should not set it to zero since otherwise (stochastic) gradient descent will explore a very small space\" - This is not the main issue. The problem is more about symmetry rather than the exploration space.\n\n(C) \"Should set it to zero since otherwise it causes a bias\" - This is incorrect. Setting weights to zero does not inherently cause a bias in the model.\n\n(D) \"Should set it to zero in order to preserve symmetry across all neurons\" - This is incorrect. While setting weights to zero does preserve symmetry, this is actually a problem, not a benefit, because it prevents the network from learning effectively.\n\nThe correct guideline is to initialize weights randomly (often using small random values) to break symmetry and allow the network to learn diverse features. Therefore, none of the given options are correct, but the reasoning aligns most closely with avoiding symmetry issues, which is related to option (D) but in the opposite sense.",

Drought would have affected agriculture and water resources, making it a significant reason for relocation.\n\n4. **All of the above**: Given the complexity of historical migrations, it is plausible that a combination of factors, including disease, warfare, and drought, could have influenced the Mogollon's decision to leave their homeland.\n\nConsidering these points, the most comprehensive answer is likely (D) all of the above, as it acknowledges the multifaceted nature of historical migrations.",

This means there is no explicit agreement on what happens to the earnest money if the buyer defaults.\n\n2. **Earnest Money**: Typically, earnest money is a deposit made to demonstrate the buyer's commitment to the purchase. If the buyer defaults, the seller often retains the earnest money as compensation for taking the property off the market and any potential losses.\n\n3. **Seller's Losses**: The seller has stated that their actual losses exceed the earnest money amount, and they could potentially recover more through legal action. This suggests that the seller has suffered a financial detriment due to the buyer's default.\n\n4. **Buyer's Circumstances**: The buyer's inability to proceed with the purchase is due to losing their job, which is an unforeseen personal circumstance. However, personal financial difficulties do not typically excuse a party from contractual obligations unless specified in the contract (e.g., a financing contingency).\n\n5. **Legal Precedents**: In many jurisdictions, if a buyer defaults, the seller is entitled to retain the earnest money unless the contract specifies otherwise or there are equitable reasons to return it.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most legally sound conclusion is:\n\n- **(A) No, because the contract was silent regarding remedies.** The absence of a specific clause regarding the return of earnest money in the event of default generally means the seller can retain it as partial compensation for their losses.

Greenwood (1988) held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for garbage left for collection in an area accessible to the public. The rationale is that garbage left in such a location is exposed to the public and accessible to anyone, including animals, children, scavengers, and the trash collector.\n\n3. **Secured Garbage**: Although the garbage was tied closed and secured with tape, the key issue is the location where it was left.

Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.",
            "Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.",
            "While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations."

However, the CWC does require signatories to declare and destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles, so this statement is inaccurate.\n\n(B) This option acknowledges the CWC's developments in prohibiting and destroying chemical weapons but highlights the lack of a supra-state authority to enforce compliance. This reflects a common critique of international treaties, where enforcement can be challenging due to the anarchic nature of international relations.\n\n(C) This option suggests that chemical weapons have a significant deterrent effect similar to nuclear weapons, leading to continued stockpiling. However, the CWC aims to eliminate chemical weapons, and most countries have committed to this goal, reducing their influence as a deterrent.\n\n(D) This option notes that while the CWC has been widely ratified, some nations with significant chemical capabilities have not joined. It also mentions the limited military utility of chemical weapons and the potential threat of their use by terrorists.\n\nConsidering these points, option (D) provides a comprehensive view of the current status of chemical weapons in international society, acknowledging both the limitations of military utility and the ongoing concerns about non-compliance and terrorism.

He was not an advocate of free trade in the sense of reducing tariffs; rather, he supported protective tariffs to nurture American industry.\n\n2. **Option (B):** Establishment of a national currency and higher government spending.\n   - While Hamilton did support a strong financial system, including a national bank, the emphasis on higher government spending is not a hallmark of his economic strategy.\n\n3. **Option (C):** Tariffs to protect American manufacturing, establishment of a national bank, and the repayment of all debts.\n   - This option accurately reflects Hamilton's policies. He advocated for protective tariffs to support American manufacturing, the creation of a national bank to stabilize and improve the nation's credit, and the federal assumption and repayment of state and national debts to establish financial credibility.\n\n4. **Option (D):** Limits on immigration and imported technology to encourage higher wages.\n   - Hamilton did not focus on limiting immigration or imported technology as part of his economic strategy.

These reforms were aimed at modernizing the Soviet Union and improving relations with the West.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, who was the U.S. President from 1989 to 1993, adopted a cautious approach towards these changes. He supported Gorbachev's reform efforts but was careful not to appear too enthusiastic, as the situation in the Soviet Union was still uncertain. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Boris Yeltsin emerged as the leader of the newly independent Russia.
