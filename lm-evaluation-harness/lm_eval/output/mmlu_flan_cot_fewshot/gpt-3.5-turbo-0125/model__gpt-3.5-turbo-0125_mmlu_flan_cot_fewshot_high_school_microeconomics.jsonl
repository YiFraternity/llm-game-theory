        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school microeconomics.\n\nQ: Which of the following is necessarily a characteristic of oligopoly?\n(A) Free entry into and exit from the market (B) A few large producers (C) One producer of a good with no close substitutes (D) A homogenous product\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. An oligopoly is when a market is dominated by just one or a few number of sellers or producers. To get oligopoly, the market should have high barriers to new entry, and the product has differentiation. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: If the government subsidizes producers in a perfectly competitive market, then\n(A) the demand for the product will increase (B) the demand for the product will decrease (C) the consumer surplus will increase (D) the consumer surplus will decrease\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. (A) and (B) are wrong because the demand curve does not change at all. If the government subsidizes producers, the supply will increase, and thus the consumer surplus also increases. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is true of a price floor?\n(A) The price floor shifts the demand curve to the left. (B) An effective floor creates a shortage of the good. (C) The price floor shifts the supply curve of the good to the right. (D) To be an effective floor, it must be set above the equilibrium price.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Price floor does not shift the demand or shift curve. An effective price floor should be set above the equilibrium price, otherwise the market bears and the floor does not have effective effect. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The concentration ratio for a monopoly is\n(A) 0 (B) 5 (C) 10 (D) 100\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The concentration ratio is calculated as the sum of market share of a specific number of largest companies. Monopoly means one company or entity controls the entire market, therefore, the concentration ratio is 100 percent. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: In a competitive labor market for housepainters, which of the following would increase the demand for housepainters?\n(A) An effective minimum wage imposed on this labor market. (B) An increase in the price of gallons of paint. (C) An increase in the construction of new houses. (D) An increase in the price of mechanical painters so long as the output effect exceeds the substitution effect.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. An increase in the construction of new houses means an increase demand of in-house painting, thus increases the demand for housepainters. The answer is (C).\nQ: If average household income rises and we observe that the demand for pork chops increases, pork chops must be\n(A) an inferior good. (B) a normal good. (C) a surplus good. (D) a public good.\nA: Let's think step by step.",
