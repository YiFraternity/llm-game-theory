        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school psychology.\n\nQ: Pascale is interested in the processing strategies children use to learn new information. Pascale would best be classified as what type of psychologist?\n(A) sociocultural (B) clinical (C) cognitive (D) behaviorist\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Sociocultural psychologist focuses on the effect of societal factors on people. Clinical psychologist focuses on people with mental issues. Cognitive psychologist focuses on how people think and learn, including the processing strategies. Behaviorist focuses more on the environment and experience effect on people. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: According to Caplan's model of consultee-centered case consultation, the consultant is primarily interested in\n(A) identifying the causes and solutions of the client's presenting problems (B) identifying and eliminating the causes of the consultee's difficulties in handling a problem (C) establishing a hierarchy of authority to enable effective decision making (D) presenting a single, well-defined and unambiguous course of action for the consultant to overcome skills deficits\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Caplan defines two type of consultation. Client-centered case consultation aims to handle client's problems, while consultee-centered case consultation aims to identify the reason of client's difficulty to solve problems. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which of the following must an educational agency do before it changes the educational placement of a student with a disability?\n(A) Give the child a trial period in the new environment (B) Notify the parents in writing (C) Obtain school board approval (D) Obtain parental consent\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. When the decision to change the educational placement of a student with a disability is made, the educational agency must notify the parents in writing on that date. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: While swimming in the ocean, Ivan is frightened by a dark shadow in the water even before he has the chance to identify what the shadow is. The synaptic connections taking place during this incident of fright are best described by which of the following?\n(A) Messages are sent from the thalamus directly to the amygdala. (B) Messages are sent from the thalamus to the \"what\" and \"where\" pathways. (C) Messages are sent from the parasympathetic nervous system to the cerebral cortex. (D) Messages are sent from the frontal lobes to the pituitary gland.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Our neural system has a mechanism that can respond immediate emotional signal before going to the thought center. In the Ivan's case, messages travel directly from thalamus to amygdala. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: Ani believes that her attitudes and behavior play a central role in what happens to her. Such a belief is likely to be associated with\n(A) a strong superego. (B) low self-esteem. (C) low self-efficacy. (D) an internal locus of control.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. People with an external locus of control believes fate and luck play an important role in their lives, while people with an internal locus of control believes they control their lives. The answer is (D).\nQ: Alyssa presents one group of shoppers with an advertisement for milk that is 99 percent fat free and another group of shoppers with an advertisement for milk that is 1 percent fat. What is Alyssa most likely testing?\n(A) representativeness heuristic (B) confirmation bias (C) schema (D) framing\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "Let's think step by step. We can refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help.\n\nRepresentativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to mind. This doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nConfirmation bias is the tendency to search for information that confirms one's preconceptions. This also doesn't seem relevant.\n\nA schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information. While the ads may tap into people's schemas about fat content, the key difference is how the information is presented.\n\nFraming is the way information is presented, and how that influences people's choices. Presenting the milk as 99% fat free vs 1% fat is an example of framing the same information in different ways.\n\nTherefore, the answer is most likely (D) framing. Alyssa seems to be testing how framing the fat content differently affects shoppers' perceptions or choices about the milk."

        "Let's think step by step. We can refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help.\n\n(A) Fixed ratio schedules require reinforcement after a fixed number of responses, while variable ratio schedules vary the number of responses required. The time required would depend on the subject's response rate, not the type of schedule.\n\n(B) The speed of results would also depend more on the subject's response rate rather than the reinforcement schedule. \n\n(C) Generalization refers to the tendency for a response to occur in situations similar to the one where it was reinforced. The Premack principle states that a high-probability behavior can be used to reinforce a low-probability behavior. Neither of these seem directly related to the choice between fixed and variable ratio schedules.\n\n(D) Variable ratio schedules do tend to be more resistant to extinction than fixed ratio schedules. With a variable schedule, the subject keeps responding because they don't know when the next reinforcement will come. With a fixed schedule, they learn to expect reinforcement only after a certain number of responses.\n\nTherefore, the best answer appears to be (D) - variable ratio schedules are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules. The unpredictability of the reinforcement maintains the behavior longer when reinforcement is discontinued."
