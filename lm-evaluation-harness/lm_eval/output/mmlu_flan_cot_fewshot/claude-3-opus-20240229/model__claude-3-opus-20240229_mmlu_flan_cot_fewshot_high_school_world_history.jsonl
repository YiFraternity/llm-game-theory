        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school world history.\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright © 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nThe \"quantum jump\" mentioned in the passage most directly contributed to which of the following developments in the period 1450–1750 C.E.?\n(A) A breakdown in trade routes through the collapse of the established state structure (B) An increase in the population of the world through more plentiful supplies of food (C) The spread of Chinese and Indian belief systems across the world (D) An increase in social unrest\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on world history for help. The \"quantum jump\" mentioned in the passage refers to the conquest of the New World and the Columbian Exchange. Choice (A) and (C) did not happen in history. Choice (C) refers to the human assets. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following provides the best context for Nkrumah's writings?\n(A) The Industrial Revolution (B) Decolonization (C) Regional Free Trade Associations (D) Autarky\nA: Let's think step by step.

The answer is (B).\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\n\"Indeed, as both the fatwas of distinguished [scholars] who base their opinion on reason and tradition alike and the consensus of the Sunni community agree that the ancient obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation must be the aim of our exalted aspiration, for \"Religious zeal is a victory for the Faith of God the Beneficent\"; then, in accordance with the words of the Prophet (Peace upon him!) \"Whosoever introduces evil innovation into our order must be expelled\" and \"Whosoever does aught against our order must be expelled,\" action has become necessary and exigent…\"\nLetter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid Shah Ismail I, 1514\nThe letter from Selim I is most clearly an example of which of the following?\n(A) The maintenance of military supremacy at all costs (B) Expanding tensions between religious sects (C) Factors that brought about the collapse of the Ottoman Empire (D) Peacemaking efforts among the Islamic empires\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on world history for help. The passage is an example of expanding tensions between Selim and Ismail. In the passage the Selim references the fatwa and the consensus of the Sunni community to against whosoever introduces evil. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: This question refers to the following information.\n\"The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nOtto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to which of the following issues?\n(A) Social acceptance of child labor (B) Declining life expectancy in Germany (C) Criticisms of German trade tariffs (D) Negative effects attributed to industrial capitalism\nA: Let's think step by step.

He enfolds the whole universe and in silence is loving to all. This is the Spirit that is in my heart, this is Brahman. To him I shall come when I go beyond this life, and to him will come he who has faith and doubts not.\n—The Upanishads, India, c. 1000 BCE\nTo which religion does the speaker most likely belong?\n(A) Hinduism (B) Buddhism (C) Shintoism (D) Zoroastrianism\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on world history for help. Brahman refers to the ultimate reality of all things in the Hindu religion. In contrast, Buddhism does not have a concept of supreme God.

We can refer to Wikipedia articles on Indian history for help.\n\nThe passage mentions that the zamindars paid revenue to the Mughal Empire, but sometimes refused to pay in order to establish a claim to sovereignty. This suggests the zamindars were landowners or local rulers under Mughal rule.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n(A) Muslim landowners - Possible, as the Mughals were a Muslim dynasty ruling India at the time. Zamindars could be Muslim.\n\n(B) Buddhist peasants - Unlikely, as peasants would not be in a position to refuse paying revenue to establish sovereignty. \n\n(C) Sikh nobility - The passage is discussing northern India under Mughal rule, before the rise of Sikh power. Unlikely the zamindars were Sikh nobles at this time.\n\n(D) Hindu aristocrats - Also possible, as many Hindu rulers and landowners came under Mughal rule across India.\n\nBased on the information provided, the zamindars were most likely landowners or local rulers, who could be either Muslim or Hindu, choice (A) or (D). The passage alone does not definitively indicate their religion. More historical context would be needed to say for certain. But (B) and (C) can be ruled out based on the details provided."

        "Let's think through this step-by-step and refer to Wikipedia articles on world history for help.\n\nThe passage mentions damage done by a \"contingent of 1,500 natives\" near the British citizen's farm in South Africa in 1879. This suggests increasing tensions and conflict between the British and local African populations as the British expanded their presence.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\n(A) While South Africa was an important British colony, it's not clear it was the most economically successful of all. This choice seems too broad.\n\n(B) The Berlin Conference (1884-85) divided up Africa among European powers. There's no evidence Britain lost land there as a penalty. \n\n(C) The Anglo-Boer Wars in 1880-81 and 1899-1902 were fought between the British and Dutch-descended Boers in South Africa. This fits with the increasing British presence and resulting conflicts described in the passage.\n\n(D) While some British settlers went to South Africa, they did not create a fully independent nation there in the late 19th century. South Africa gained independence later, in 1910.\n\nTherefore, the best answer appears to be (C) - the expanding British presence led to war with the Boers, who were descendants of earlier Dutch settlers in South Africa. The passage provides useful context clues pointing to this rising conflict."
