We can refer to Wikipedia articles on geography for help.\n\nIn a federal state:\n- There is a division of powers between a central government and regional governments (states, provinces, etc.). This matches option (A).\n- The regional governments have some autonomy and unique powers separate from the central government. This matches option (D). \n- Federal states often have a written constitution that specifies the division of powers. This matches option (C).\n\nHowever, in a federal state, the central government does not govern the entire country as a single unit. That would be more characteristic of a unitary state rather than a federal state.\n\nTherefore, the situation that does NOT occur in a federal state is (B) - the central government governing the country as a single unit.\n\nThe answer is (B)."

        "Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on geography for help.\n\nZoning is a method of urban planning in which a municipality or other tier of government divides land into areas called zones, each of which has a set of regulations for new development that differs from other zones. Zoning is the primary planning tool to separate land uses that are thought to be incompatible and to prevent new development from interfering with existing uses.\n\nTypical zoning categories include residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and open space. Within these categories, there may be additional restrictions on building height, lot size, density, setbacks, parking, and other aspects of development. Zoning can be used to separate housing areas from industrial facilities like sewage treatment plants that may cause noise, odor or other nuisances.\n\nFences, malls and tunnels are physical structures that provide barriers or connections between areas, but are not the primary legal tool used by city planners to separate incompatible land uses across a city or region. That is achieved through zoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Zoning."
