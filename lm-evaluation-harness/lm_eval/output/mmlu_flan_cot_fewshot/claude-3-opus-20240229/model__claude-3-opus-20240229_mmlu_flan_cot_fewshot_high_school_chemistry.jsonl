        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school chemistry.\n\nQ: Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?\n(A) HCl (B) H2SO3 (C) SO2 (D) Al(NO3)3\nA: Let's think step by step. An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid. The chemical formula for water is H2O, which means that we need to determine which of these options, when combined with H2O, forms an acid. SO2, or Sulfur dioxide, when combined with H2O, makes H2SO4, or sulfuric acid. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Which of the following is expected to be a polar molecule?\n(A) PCl4F (B) BF3 (C) CO2 (D) Si(CH3)4\nA: Let's think step by step. A polar molecule is one that has a slightly positive charge on one end of the molecule and a slightly negative charge on the other end. Boron trifluoride (BF3) has Boron as the center atom and three fluorine atoms attached to it; it is trigonal planar and symmetric, so it is nonpolar. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has Carbon as the central atom with double bonds to two Oxygen atoms - this is also symmetrical and therefore nonpolar. The same is the case for tetramethyl silane (SI(CH3)4), which is a Silicon atom surrounded by four methyl groups. The structure of PCL4F is that Phosphorus is the central atom, attached to four chlorines and one fluorine atom. This is asymmetrical, and therefore has a net dipole and is expected to be a polar molecule. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?\n(A) All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble (B) All sulfates are soluble (C) All hydroxides are soluble (D) All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble\nA: Let's think step by step. The chlorides, bromides, and iodides of lead, silver, and mercury are not soluble in water. This rules out (A). The sulfates of lead, barium, and calcium are not soluble in water, which rules out (B). The hydroxides of any metal besides sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, and barium are insoluble. This rules out (C). Typically ammonium ions indicate a soluble ionic substance. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?\n(A) 3.89 (B) 7.78 (C) 5.78 (D) 2.33\nA: Let's think step by step. Recall that $[A] = [H^{+}]$. Here, this is equal to $$10^{-3.89}$. Then we have $K_{a} = $\nrac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = \nrac{10^{-3.89} \\cdot 10^{-3.89}}{10^{-2}}. The resulting exponent is $-3.89 + (-3.89) - (-2) = 5.78$, therefore $K_a = 10^{-5.78}$. The $pK_a$ is the negative log of $K_a$, which is equal to $5.78$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?\n(A) 0.500 mole (B) 1.00 mole (C) 2.00 mole (D) 3.00 mole\nA: Let's think step by step. We would like to compute the buffer capacity of this solution. First we write the equation for the ionization of the weak acid, in this case of acetic acid. $CH_{3}COOH (aq) + H_{2}O \nightarrow H_{3}O^{+} + CH3COO^{-}$. The conjugate base is therefore the acetate ion. The added strong acid, Nitric acid, will react with the conjugate base. Therefore the maximum amount of acid that can be added will be equal to the amount of acetate ion, or 2 moles. The answer is (C).\nQ: Consider the Lewis structures for the following molecules: CO2, CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-. Which molecule would have the smallest bond angle between terminal atoms?\n(A) CO2 (B) CO32- (C) NO2- (D) NO3-\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "Let's think step by step.\n\nCO2: Carbon dioxide is a linear molecule with no lone pairs on the central carbon atom. Its bond angle is 180°.\n\nCO32-: The carbonate ion has a trigonal planar structure with no lone pairs on the central carbon atom. Its bond angles are all 120°.\n\nNO2-: The nitrite ion has a bent structure with one lone pair on the central nitrogen atom. Lone pairs repel more strongly than bonding pairs, so the bond angle is slightly less than 120°, around 115°.\n\nNO3-: The nitrate ion has a trigonal planar structure with no lone pairs on the central nitrogen atom, similar to CO32-. Its bond angles are all 120°.\n\nAmong these, NO2- has the smallest bond angle due to the presence of the lone pair on the central nitrogen atom, which compresses the bond angle to less than 120°.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) NO2-."

        "Let's think step by step.\n\n(A) This is correct. In the ground state, electrons occupy the lowest available energy levels (orbitals). \n\n(B) While elements in their ground state are commonly found in nature, this is not the definition of a ground state. Elements can also be found in excited states in nature.\n\n(C) The ground state refers to the electron configuration, not the reactivity or occurrence of an element. Many elements in their ground states are highly reactive and/or not found free in nature.\n\n(D) Having all electrons paired is not a requirement for the ground state. Many elements have unpaired electrons in their ground state (e.g., most transition metals).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A). In the ground state, an element has all its electrons in the lowest possible energy levels."
