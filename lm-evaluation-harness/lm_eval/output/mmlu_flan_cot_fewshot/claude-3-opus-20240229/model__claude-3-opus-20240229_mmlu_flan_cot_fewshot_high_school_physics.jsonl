        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school physics.\n\nQ: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n(A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W\nA: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 µC, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step. To calculate the work required to move a charge from one location to another in a fixed electric field, it is enough to calculate the potential difference between the two locations. Here, the potential only depends on the distance between the charges; it’s $k q_1 q_2 / r$, where $k$ is Coulomb’s constant. Plugging in values $q_1 = $ 1 mC, $q_2 = 8 \\mu$ C, gives the answer as 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque\n(A) I and II only (B) I and III only (C) II and III only (D) III only\nA: Let's think step by step. Torque is defined as the change in angular momentum; if there is zero external torque, angular momentum is conserved. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A photocell of work function ϕ = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 × 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\n(A) 2:00 AM (B) 6:00 AM (C) 12:00 AM (D) 24 A\nA: Let's think step by step. The only answer above which has units of current is D, 24 A. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a note. Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave’s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n(A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode. (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node. (C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. (D) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.\nA: Let's think step by step. At the closed end of the pipe, the particles cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to be maximal, i.e. an antinode. The answer is (B).\nQ: A lightweight toy car crashes head-on into a heavier toy truck. Which of the following statements is true as a result of the collision? I. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck. II. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck. III.

        "Let's think step by step.\n\nI. Impulse is the change in momentum. By Newton's third law, the force exerted by the car on the truck is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the truck on the car. These forces act for the same time interval, so the impulse experienced by the car and truck are equal and opposite. Statement I is false.\n\nII. As stated above, the impulses on the car and truck are equal and opposite. Impulse equals change in momentum, so the changes in momentum of the car and truck are also equal and opposite. Statement II is false.\n\nIII. From Newton's second law, F = ma. The car and truck experience equal forces (Newton's third law), but the car has less mass. So the car must experience a greater acceleration. Statement III is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C). Only statement III is correct."

        "Let's think step by step.\n\nWhen the bulbs are connected in series, the same current flows through both of them. The power dissipated by each bulb is given by $P = I^2 R$, where $I$ is the current and $R$ is the resistance of the bulb.\n\nWe know that the 100-W bulb has half the resistance of the 50-W bulb when they are connected to the same voltage (because $P = V^2/R$, and the 100-W bulb dissipates twice the power at the same voltage).\n\nLet's call the resistance of the 100-W bulb $R$. Then the resistance of the 50-W bulb is $2R$. \n\nIn series, the total resistance is $R + 2R = 3R$. The current through the circuit is $I = V/3R$.\n\nThe power dissipated by the 100-W bulb is:\n$P_{100} = I^2 R = (V/3R)^2 R = V^2/9R$\n\nThe power dissipated by the 50-W bulb is:\n$P_{50} = I^2 2R = (V/3R)^2 2R = 2V^2/9R$\n\nThe ratio of these powers is:\n$P_{50}/P_{100} = (2V^2/9R)/(V^2/9R) = 2$\n\nTherefore, the 50-W bulb dissipates twice as much power as the 100-W bulb when they are in series. This means the 50-W bulb will be twice as bright.\n\nThe answer is (C)."
