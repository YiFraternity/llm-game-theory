        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school mathematics.\n\nQ: Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$\n(A) \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3} (B) \\frac{1}{3} (C) \\sqrt{3} (D) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\nA: Let's think step by step. Factoring $729=3^6$ and combining the roots $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{12}$, we get that $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{3^6}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{12}}=\\frac{1}{3^{\\frac{1}{2}}}=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}$ The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?\n(A) 12 (B) 1 (C) 30 (D) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. To go from $\\$300$ to $\\$9600$, the value must go up by a factor of $9600/300=32=2^5$. Since at this interest rate it takes six years for it to double, it will take $5*6=30$ years to grow to $\\$9600$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Ten students take a biology test and receive the following scores: 45, 55, 50, 70, 65, 80, 40, 90, 70, 85. What is the mean of the students’ test scores?\n(A) 55 (B) 60 (C) 62 (D) 65\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 10 students and the sum of their scores is $45 + 55 + 50 + 70 + 65 + 80 + 40 + 90 + 70 + 85 = 650$, the mean is $650/10=65$. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$?\n(A) -1 (B) 16 (C) -\\frac{1}{256} (D) \\frac{1}{16}\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that $x \\propto y^2$ and $y \\propto z^3$, so $x = k z^6$ for some constant $k$. Plugging in for $x=-16$ and $z=2$, the constant value is $k=\\frac{x}{z^6}=\\frac{-16}{64}=-\\frac{1}{4}$. So, when $z=\\frac{1}{2}$, the value of $x$ is $x=kz^6=-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{2^6}=-\\frac{1}{256}$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)\n(A) 3 (B) 15 (C) 6 (D) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. The least common multiple of 2, 3 and 5 is 30, so during a 7 minute dance, all the three lights will come on at the same time $2*7+1=15$ times. The answer is (B).\nQ: Exits on a highway are numbered consecutively from 1 to 50. The distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km.

        "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the distance between exit 47 and exit 48 while ensuring that the total distance from exit 41 to exit 50 remains 100 km and each exit is at least 6 km apart.\n\nWe have 10 exits from 41 to 50, which means there are 9 segments (distances between consecutive exits). Each segment must be at least 6 km. Therefore, the minimum total distance for 9 segments is \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\) km. Since the total distance is 100 km, we have \\(100 - 54 = 46\\) km left to distribute among these 9 segments.\n\nTo maximize the distance between exit 47 and exit 48, we should minimize the distances of the other segments. If we assign the minimum distance of 6 km to each of the other 8 segments, the total distance used for these segments would be \\(8 \\times 6 = 48\\) km. This leaves \\(100 - 48 = 52\\) km for the segment between exit 47 and exit 48.\n\nThus, the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48, while satisfying all conditions, is 52 km.

However, this is impossible because if everyone tells the truth, then a statement that \"exactly one of these two is lying\" cannot be true.\n- If all are liars (T = 0, L = 11), each person's statement should be false. This is also impossible because a liar cannot correctly claim that exactly one between any two is lying.\n\nWe need to find a balance between"
