        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school physics.\n\nQ: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n(A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W\nA: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 µC, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step. To calculate the work required to move a charge from one location to another in a fixed electric field, it is enough to calculate the potential difference between the two locations. Here, the potential only depends on the distance between the charges; it’s $k q_1 q_2 / r$, where $k$ is Coulomb’s constant. Plugging in values $q_1 = $ 1 mC, $q_2 = 8 \\mu$ C, gives the answer as 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque\n(A) I and II only (B) I and III only (C) II and III only (D) III only\nA: Let's think step by step. Torque is defined as the change in angular momentum; if there is zero external torque, angular momentum is conserved. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A photocell of work function ϕ = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 × 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\n(A) 2:00 AM (B) 6:00 AM (C) 12:00 AM (D) 24 A\nA: Let's think step by step. The only answer above which has units of current is D, 24 A. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a note. Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave’s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n(A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode. (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node. (C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. (D) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.\nA: Let's think step by step. At the closed end of the pipe, the particles cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to be maximal, i.e. an antinode. The answer is (B).\nQ: A lightweight toy car crashes head-on into a heavier toy truck. Which of the following statements is true as a result of the collision? I. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck. II. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck. III.

        "For the question about the toy car and toy truck collision, let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck.\n- Impulse is defined as the change in momentum, which is equal for both the car and the truck due to the conservation of momentum and Newton's third law (action equals reaction). Therefore, both the car and the truck experience the same impulse.\n\nII. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck.\n- The change in momentum for both the car and the truck is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, again due to the conservation of momentum and Newton's third law.\n\nIII. The magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the car will be greater than that experienced by the truck.\n- Since acceleration is the change in velocity divided by time and given that the car has less mass than the truck, for the same impulse (change in momentum), the car will experience a greater acceleration compared to the truck. This is because \\( a = \\frac{\\Delta p}{m} \\), where \\( \\Delta p \\) is the change in momentum and \\( m \\) is the mass. The smaller mass of the car results in a larger acceleration for the same change in momentum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is"
