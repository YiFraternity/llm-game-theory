        "Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:\n\nIn a federal state system, there are two levels of government - the central/national government and the state/provincial/territorial governments.\n\nA) This is true for a federal state, which has a two-level system of central and state/provincial governments.\n\nB) This is false for a federal state. In a federal system, the country is not governed as a single unit by the central government alone. The states/provinces have their own powers and jurisdictions.\n\nC) This is generally true for federal states, which tend to have written constitutions outlining the division of powers.\n\nD) This is true for federal states, where the lower-level state/provincial governments have certain unique powers outlined in the constitution.\n\nSo the statement that does NOT occur in a federal state is (B) - the central government governing the country as a single unit. The essence of a federal system is the division of powers between the central and state/provincial governments.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B)."

        "Based on the multiple choice options provided, the most relevant answer is (C) Zoning.\n\nCity planners use zoning laws and regulations to separate different land uses like residential areas from industrial areas that may have sewage plants or other facilities that could negatively impact housing. Zoning allows for designating specific areas or zones within a city/town for different purposes like residential, commercial, industrial, etc. This helps prevent incompatible land uses from being located next to each other.\n\nThe other options like malls, fences, and tunnels are not as directly relevant to separating discordant land uses through urban planning practices. Zoning is the primary tool used by city planners to regulate land use in an organized manner."
