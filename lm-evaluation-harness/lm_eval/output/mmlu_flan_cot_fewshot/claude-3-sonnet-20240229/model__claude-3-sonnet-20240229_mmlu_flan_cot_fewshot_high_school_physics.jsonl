        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school physics.\n\nQ: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n(A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W\nA: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 µC, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step. To calculate the work required to move a charge from one location to another in a fixed electric field, it is enough to calculate the potential difference between the two locations. Here, the potential only depends on the distance between the charges; it’s $k q_1 q_2 / r$, where $k$ is Coulomb’s constant. Plugging in values $q_1 = $ 1 mC, $q_2 = 8 \\mu$ C, gives the answer as 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque\n(A) I and II only (B) I and III only (C) II and III only (D) III only\nA: Let's think step by step. Torque is defined as the change in angular momentum; if there is zero external torque, angular momentum is conserved. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A photocell of work function ϕ = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 × 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\n(A) 2:00 AM (B) 6:00 AM (C) 12:00 AM (D) 24 A\nA: Let's think step by step. The only answer above which has units of current is D, 24 A. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a note. Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave’s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n(A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode. (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node. (C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. (D) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.\nA: Let's think step by step. At the closed end of the pipe, the particles cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to be maximal, i.e. an antinode. The answer is (B).\nQ: A lightweight toy car crashes head-on into a heavier toy truck. Which of the following statements is true as a result of the collision? I. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck. II. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck. III. The magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the car will be greater than that experienced by the truck.\n(A) I and II only (B) II only (C) III only (D) II and III only\nA: Let's think step by step.",

        "Here are my step-by-step thoughts on the multiple choice question about the toy car and truck collision:\n\nI. The impulse experienced is the same for both objects, since impulse = change in momentum, and by Newton's 3rd law, the forces are equal and opposite during the collision. So this statement is false.\n\nII. This is true. The lighter car will experience a greater change in momentum than the heavier truck, since momentum = mass x velocity. With the same force applied, the lighter mass will undergo a larger change in velocity and thus momentum.\n\nIII. This is also true. From Newton's 2nd law F=ma, the lighter mass car will experience a greater acceleration than the heavier truck, since the force is the same on both but the mass of the car is less.\n\nSo the correct combination is statements II and III only, which is answer choice (D)."

        "To solve these multiple choice physics questions, I will go through each one step-by-step:\n\nQ1: The rate of energy usage or power P is given by P = IV, where I is the current and V is the voltage. Given I = 2 A and V = 120 V, we get P = 2 * 120 = 240 W. So the correct answer is (D).\n\nQ2: To calculate the work required to move a charge Q2 from point (0,4) to (3,0) in the electric field of a charge Q1 at the origin, we use the formula:\nWork = kQ1Q2 [ (1/r2) - (1/r1) ]\nWhere k is the Coulomb constant, r1 and r2 are the initial and final distances from Q1.\nPlugging in k = 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2, Q1 = 1 x 10^-3 C, Q2 = 8 x 10^-6 C, r1 = 4 m, r2 = sqrt(3^2 + 0^2) = 3 m, we get Work = 5.992 J ≈ 6 J. So (B) is correct.\n\nQ3: Angular momentum is conserved when there is no net external torque acting on the system. This is condition III. So the correct answer is (D).\n\nQ4: This question has a misleading answer choice. The power 100 W is not a current. To find the current, we need to use the photoelectric equation:\nEmax = hf - ϕ\nWhere Emax is the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons, h is Planck's constant, f is the light frequency and ϕ is the work function.\nPlugging in the given values, we get Emax = 6.63 x 10^-34 * 1 x 10^15 - 2 * 1.6 x 10^-19 = 4.21 x 10^-19 J\nThis kinetic energy gets converted to electrical energy in the circuit. The rate of this energy conversion is the power 100 W = 100 J/s.\nSo the current I = 100 J/s / (4.21 x 10^-19 J/electron) = 2.38 x 10^20 electrons/s\nUsing the charge of an electron 1.6 x 10^-19 C, this gives I = 2.38 x 10^20 * 1.6 x 10^-19 = 3.8 A\nNone of the given options are correct.\n\nQ5: At the closed end of a pipe, the air particles cannot move, so there is a displacement node. However, the particles get compressed maximally, so there is a pressure antinode. Hence, (B) is the correct answer.\n\nQ6: When bulbs are connected in parallel across a voltage source, they have the same voltage drop across them. So their brightness, which depends on power P = V^2/R, is inversely proportional to their resistance R.\nIf one bulb is twice as bright, its resistance must be half that of the other bulb.\n\nWhen connected in series, the same current flows through both bulbs. The voltage drops are proportional to the resistances. \nSo if R1 = 2R2, then V1 = 2V2. Using P = IV, we get P1 = I^2R1 = 2IR2 = 2P2.\n\nSo the 100W bulb, which had half the resistance of the 50W bulb in parallel, now has twice the power dissipation when in series. Its brightness is twice that of the 50W bulb.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B)."
