        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school psychology.\n\nQ: Pascale is interested in the processing strategies children use to learn new information. Pascale would best be classified as what type of psychologist?\n(A) sociocultural (B) clinical (C) cognitive (D) behaviorist\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Sociocultural psychologist focuses on the effect of societal factors on people. Clinical psychologist focuses on people with mental issues. Cognitive psychologist focuses on how people think and learn, including the processing strategies. Behaviorist focuses more on the environment and experience effect on people. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: According to Caplan's model of consultee-centered case consultation, the consultant is primarily interested in\n(A) identifying the causes and solutions of the client's presenting problems (B) identifying and eliminating the causes of the consultee's difficulties in handling a problem (C) establishing a hierarchy of authority to enable effective decision making (D) presenting a single, well-defined and unambiguous course of action for the consultant to overcome skills deficits\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Caplan defines two type of consultation. Client-centered case consultation aims to handle client's problems, while consultee-centered case consultation aims to identify the reason of client's difficulty to solve problems. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which of the following must an educational agency do before it changes the educational placement of a student with a disability?\n(A) Give the child a trial period in the new environment (B) Notify the parents in writing (C) Obtain school board approval (D) Obtain parental consent\nA: Let's think step by step.

The synaptic connections taking place during this incident of fright are best described by which of the following?\n(A) Messages are sent from the thalamus directly to the amygdala. (B) Messages are sent from the thalamus to the \"what\" and \"where\" pathways. (C) Messages are sent from the parasympathetic nervous system to the cerebral cortex. (D) Messages are sent from the frontal lobes to the pituitary gland.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Our neural system has a mechanism that can respond immediate emotional signal before going to the thought center. In the Ivan's case, messages travel directly from thalamus to amygdala.

        "Based on the information provided, Alyssa is most likely testing the framing effect.\n\nThe framing effect refers to the way information is presented (framed) can influence people's choices and decisions, even when the core information is essentially the same.\n\nIn this case, Alyssa is presenting two different groups with the same information about the fat content of milk, but framed in different ways:\n\n1) 99% fat-free\n2) 1% fat\n\nDespite conveying the same essential information, the way it is framed (as fat-free vs. containing fat) can potentially influence the shoppers' perceptions and decisions regarding the milk.\n\nBy testing the two different framings, Alyssa is likely investigating whether this framing effect occurs and how it impacts the shoppers' responses to the advertisements.\n\nThe other options are not as relevant to the scenario described:\n- Representativeness heuristic relates to judging probability based on stereotypes/representations\n- Confirmation bias refers to favoring information that confirms existing beliefs\n- Schema relates to existing mental frameworks/concepts for understanding information\n\nSo the correct answer is D) framing, as Alyssa appears to be testing how different framings of the same information can influence people's perceptions and decisions."

        "Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nIn operant conditioning, reinforcement schedules determine the pattern of reinforcement delivery after a desired behavior is performed. There are different types of schedules, including fixed ratio and variable ratio schedules.\n\nA fixed ratio schedule reinforces a behavior after a fixed number of responses (e.g., every 5th response is reinforced).\n\nA variable ratio schedule reinforces a behavior after an unpredictable number of responses, with an average number of responses required for reinforcement (e.g., on average, every 10th response is reinforced, but the exact number varies).\n\nVariable ratio schedules are more resistant to extinction than fixed ratio schedules because the unpredictability of the reinforcement makes the behavior more persistent. The organism cannot predict when the next reinforcement will occur, so they continue the behavior for a longer period even when reinforcement is withheld (extinction phase).\n\nTherefore, a researcher might use a variable ratio schedule of reinforcement instead of a fixed ratio schedule because it is more resistant to extinction, leading to a more persistent behavior."
