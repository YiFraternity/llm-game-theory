        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school mathematics.\n\nQ: Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$\n(A) \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3} (B) \\frac{1}{3} (C) \\sqrt{3} (D) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\nA: Let's think step by step. Factoring $729=3^6$ and combining the roots $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{12}$, we get that $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{3^6}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{12}}=\\frac{1}{3^{\\frac{1}{2}}}=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}$ The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?\n(A) 12 (B) 1 (C) 30 (D) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. To go from $\\$300$ to $\\$9600$, the value must go up by a factor of $9600/300=32=2^5$. Since at this interest rate it takes six years for it to double, it will take $5*6=30$ years to grow to $\\$9600$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Ten students take a biology test and receive the following scores: 45, 55, 50, 70, 65, 80, 40, 90, 70, 85. What is the mean of the students’ test scores?\n(A) 55 (B) 60 (C) 62 (D) 65\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 10 students and the sum of their scores is $45 + 55 + 50 + 70 + 65 + 80 + 40 + 90 + 70 + 85 = 650$, the mean is $650/10=65$. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$?\n(A) -1 (B) 16 (C) -\\frac{1}{256} (D) \\frac{1}{16}\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that $x \\propto y^2$ and $y \\propto z^3$, so $x = k z^6$ for some constant $k$. Plugging in for $x=-16$ and $z=2$, the constant value is $k=\\frac{x}{z^6}=\\frac{-16}{64}=-\\frac{1}{4}$. So, when $z=\\frac{1}{2}$, the value of $x$ is $x=kz^6=-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{2^6}=-\\frac{1}{256}$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)\n(A) 3 (B) 15 (C) 6 (D) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. The least common multiple of 2, 3 and 5 is 30, so during a 7 minute dance, all the three lights will come on at the same time $2*7+1=15$ times. The answer is (B).\nQ: Exits on a highway are numbered consecutively from 1 to 50. The distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km.

        "Thank you for providing these multiple choice questions with detailed explanations. Going through practice questions with step-by-step solutions is an excellent way to reinforce understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving techniques. The questions cover a range of topics, including simplifying expressions with roots and rational exponents, exponential growth and compound interest, statistics (mean), direct and inverse variation, patterns and sequences, and distance/rate problems. The explanations clearly lay out the logical steps required to arrive at the correct answer choice for each question. Working through questions like these helps build proficiency in applying relevant formulas, setting up equations, using algebraic manipulation techniques, and developing a systematic approach to solving different types of math word problems."
