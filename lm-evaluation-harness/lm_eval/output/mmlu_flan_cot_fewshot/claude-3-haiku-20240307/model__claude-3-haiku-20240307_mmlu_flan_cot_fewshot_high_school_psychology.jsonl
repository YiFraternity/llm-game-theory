        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school psychology.\n\nQ: Pascale is interested in the processing strategies children use to learn new information. Pascale would best be classified as what type of psychologist?\n(A) sociocultural (B) clinical (C) cognitive (D) behaviorist\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Sociocultural psychologist focuses on the effect of societal factors on people. Clinical psychologist focuses on people with mental issues. Cognitive psychologist focuses on how people think and learn, including the processing strategies. Behaviorist focuses more on the environment and experience effect on people. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: According to Caplan's model of consultee-centered case consultation, the consultant is primarily interested in\n(A) identifying the causes and solutions of the client's presenting problems (B) identifying and eliminating the causes of the consultee's difficulties in handling a problem (C) establishing a hierarchy of authority to enable effective decision making (D) presenting a single, well-defined and unambiguous course of action for the consultant to overcome skills deficits\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Caplan defines two type of consultation. Client-centered case consultation aims to handle client's problems, while consultee-centered case consultation aims to identify the reason of client's difficulty to solve problems. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which of the following must an educational agency do before it changes the educational placement of a student with a disability?\n(A) Give the child a trial period in the new environment (B) Notify the parents in writing (C) Obtain school board approval (D) Obtain parental consent\nA: Let's think step by step.

(B) Messages are sent from the thalamus to the \"what\" and \"where\" pathways. (C) Messages are sent from the parasympathetic nervous system to the cerebral cortex. (D) Messages are sent from the frontal lobes to the pituitary gland.\nA: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Our neural system has a mechanism that can respond immediate emotional signal before going to the thought center. In the Ivan's case, messages travel directly from thalamus to amygdala.

        "Okay, let's go through these questions step-by-step:\n\nQ1: Pascale is interested in the processing strategies children use to learn new information. Pascale would best be classified as what type of psychologist?\nA: The answer is (C) cognitive. Cognitive psychologists focus on how people think, learn, and process information. Since Pascale is interested in the processing strategies children use to learn new information, she would be classified as a cognitive psychologist.\n\nQ2: According to Caplan's model of consultee-centered case consultation, the consultant is primarily interested in...\nA: The answer is (B) identifying and eliminating the causes of the consultee's difficulties in handling a problem. Consultee-centered case consultation focuses on helping the consultee (e.g. a teacher) overcome their own difficulties in dealing with a client's (e.g. a student's) problem.\n\nQ3: According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which of the following must an educational agency do before it changes the educational placement of a student with a disability?\nA: The answer is (B) Notify the parents in writing. The law requires that parents be notified in writing before any changes are made to a student's educational placement.\n\nQ4: While swimming in the ocean, Ivan is frightened by a dark shadow in the water even before he has the chance to identify what the shadow is. The synaptic connections taking place during this incident of fright are best described by which of the following?\nA: The answer is (A) Messages are sent from the thalamus directly to the amygdala. This rapid emotional response, before the \"thinking\" part of the brain has had a chance to process the information, is mediated by a direct connection from the thalamus to the amygdala.\n\nQ5: Ani believes that her attitudes and behavior play a central role in what happens to her. Such a belief is likely to be associated with...\nA: The answer is (D) an internal locus of control. People with an internal locus of control believe that they have control over the outcomes in their lives, rather than believing that external factors like luck or fate are in control.\n\nQ6: Alyssa presents one group of shoppers with an advertisement for milk that is 99 percent fat free and another group of shoppers with an advertisement for milk that is 1 percent fat. What is Alyssa most likely testing?\nA: The answer is (D) framing. Framing refers to how information is presented or \"framed\" can influence people's perceptions and decisions, even if the underlying information is the same. In this case, Alyssa is testing how the framing of the milk's fat content (99% fat free vs. 1% fat) affects shoppers' perceptions and decisions."

Q: Why might a researcher use a variable ratio of reinforcement rather than a fixed ratio?\n   A: The answer is (D) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules. Variable ratio schedules, where the number of responses required for reinforcement varies, tend to produce more persistent behavior that is less likely to be extinguished compared to fixed ratio schedules."
