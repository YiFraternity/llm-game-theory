        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school mathematics.\n\nQ: Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$\n(A) \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3} (B) \\frac{1}{3} (C) \\sqrt{3} (D) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\nA: Let's think step by step. Factoring $729=3^6$ and combining the roots $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{12}$, we get that $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{3^6}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{12}}=\\frac{1}{3^{\\frac{1}{2}}}=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}$ The answer is (D).\n\nQ: Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?\n(A) 12 (B) 1 (C) 30 (D) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. To go from $\\$300$ to $\\$9600$, the value must go up by a factor of $9600/300=32=2^5$. Since at this interest rate it takes six years for it to double, it will take $5*6=30$ years to grow to $\\$9600$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Ten students take a biology test and receive the following scores: 45, 55, 50, 70, 65, 80, 40, 90, 70, 85. What is the mean of the students’ test scores?\n(A) 55 (B) 60 (C) 62 (D) 65\nA: Let's think step by step. There are 10 students and the sum of their scores is $45 + 55 + 50 + 70 + 65 + 80 + 40 + 90 + 70 + 85 = 650$, the mean is $650/10=65$. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$?\n(A) -1 (B) 16 (C) -\\frac{1}{256} (D) \\frac{1}{16}\nA: Let's think step by step. We know that $x \\propto y^2$ and $y \\propto z^3$, so $x = k z^6$ for some constant $k$. Plugging in for $x=-16$ and $z=2$, the constant value is $k=\\frac{x}{z^6}=\\frac{-16}{64}=-\\frac{1}{4}$. So, when $z=\\frac{1}{2}$, the value of $x$ is $x=kz^6=-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{2^6}=-\\frac{1}{256}$. The answer is (C).\n\nQ: Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)\n(A) 3 (B) 15 (C) 6 (D) 5\nA: Let's think step by step. The least common multiple of 2, 3 and 5 is 30, so during a 7 minute dance, all the three lights will come on at the same time $2*7+1=15$ times. The answer is (B).\nQ: Exits on a highway are numbered consecutively from 1 to 50. The distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km.

        "Okay, let's go through the questions and answers step-by-step:\n\n1. Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$\n   - Factoring 729 = 3^6, we get $\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3^6}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{12}} = \\frac{1}{3^{\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n   - The answer is (D) $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\n2. Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?\n   - If $\\$5000$ doubles in 6 years, then the interest rate is $\\frac{\\ln(2)}{6} \\approx 0.1155$ or 11.55% per year.\n   - To go from $\\$300$ to $\\$9600$, the value must go up by a factor of $\\frac{9600}{300} = 32 = 2^5$.\n   - Since it takes 6 years to double at this interest rate, it will take $5 \\times 6 = 30$ years to grow to $\\$9600$.\n   - The answer is (C) 30 years.\n\n3.

The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$?\n   - Since $x \\propto y^2$ and $y \\propto z^3$, we have $x = kz^6$ for some constant $k$.\n   - Plugging in $x = -16$ and $z = 2$, we get $k = \\frac{x}{z^6} = \\frac{-16}{64} = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n   - When $z = \\frac{1}{2}$, the value of $x$ is $x = kz^6 = -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = -\\frac{1}{256}$.\n   - The answer is (C) $-\\frac{1}{256}$.\n\n5. Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)\n   - The least common multiple of 2, 3, and 5 is 30, so during a 7-minute dance (420 seconds), all three lights will come on at the same time $\\frac{420}{30} = 14$ times.\n   - However, we need to include the very beginning and very end, so the total number of times is 15.\n   - The answer is (B) 15.\n\n6. Exits on a highway are numbered consecutively from 1 to 50. The distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km. If each exit is at least 6 km from the next exit, what is the longest possible distance, in kilometers, between exit 47 and exit 48?\n   - Since the distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km, and each exit is at least 6 km from the next, the total distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is at least $9 \\times 6 = 54$ km.\n   - Therefore, the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48 is $100 - 54 = 46$ km.\n   - The answer is (A) 52 km."

At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?\n   - The correct answer is (C) 30\n   - Explanation: Since the value doubles every 6 years, to go from $\\$300$ to $\\$9600$ (a factor of 32 = $2^5$), it will take $5 \\times 6 = 30$ years.\n\n3.

What is the mean of the students' test scores?\n   - The correct answer is (D) 65\n   - Explanation: The sum of the scores is $650$, and there are $10$ students, so the mean is $650 / 10 = 65$.\n\n4.

(Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)\n   - The correct answer is (B) 15\n   - Explanation: The least common multiple of 2, 3, and 5 is 30, so during a 7-minute (420-second) dance, all three lights will come on at the same time $\\lfloor\\frac{420}{30}\\rfloor + 1 = 15$ times.\n\n6. In a group of 11 people, T of them always tell the truth, and L always lie. Each person names two other people and claims that of the two, exactly one of them is lying. Each person is named in this way by exactly two other people. Find the sum of all possible values of T.\n   - The correct answer is (A) 30\n   - Explanation: This is a more complex problem, but the key insight is that the number of people named as liars must equal the number of people named as truth-tellers. Since each person names two others, the total number of names is $11 \\times 2 = 22$. Since exactly one of the two named is a liar, the number of liars must be 11. Therefore, the number of truth-tellers, T, must be 11 as well, and the sum of all possible values of T is 30."
