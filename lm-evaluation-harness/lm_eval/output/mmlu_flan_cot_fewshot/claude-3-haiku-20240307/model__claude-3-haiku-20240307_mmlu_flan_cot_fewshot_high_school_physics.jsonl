        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school physics.\n\nQ: A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n(A) 10 W (B) 30 W (C) 60 W (D) 240 W\nA: Let's think step by step. Rate of energy usage is known as power; in an dissipative electrical circuit, power is given by voltage times current. So in our case, the power is 120 V times 2 amps, or 240 W. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 µC, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n(A) 3.5 J (B) 6.0 J (C) 22.5 J (D) 40 J\nA: Let's think step by step. To calculate the work required to move a charge from one location to another in a fixed electric field, it is enough to calculate the potential difference between the two locations. Here, the potential only depends on the distance between the charges; it’s $k q_1 q_2 / r$, where $k$ is Coulomb’s constant. Plugging in values $q_1 = $ 1 mC, $q_2 = 8 \\mu$ C, gives the answer as 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J. The answer is (B).\n\nQ: Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque\n(A) I and II only (B) I and III only (C) II and III only (D) III only\nA: Let's think step by step. Torque is defined as the change in angular momentum; if there is zero external torque, angular momentum is conserved. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A photocell of work function ϕ = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 × 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\n(A) 2:00 AM (B) 6:00 AM (C) 12:00 AM (D) 24 A\nA: Let's think step by step. The only answer above which has units of current is D, 24 A. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a note. Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave’s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n(A) The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode. (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node. (C) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes. (D) The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.\nA: Let's think step by step. At the closed end of the pipe, the particles cannot have any net displacement because the pipe closure stops them. So the particle displacement is at a node. This closure also causes the pressure to be maximal, i.e. an antinode. The answer is (B).\nQ: A lightweight toy car crashes head-on into a heavier toy truck. Which of the following statements is true as a result of the collision? I. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck. II. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck. III.

At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\n   A: The rate of energy usage, or power, is given by voltage times current. So in this case, the power is 120 V * 2 A = 240 W. The correct answer is (D) 240 W.\n\n2. Q: A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 μC, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\n   A: To calculate the work required, we need to find the potential difference between the two points. The potential at a distance r from a point charge Q is given by V = kQ/r, where k is Coulomb's constant. Plugging in the values, the potential difference is 5.992 J, which rounds to 6 J. The correct answer is (B) 6.0 J.\n\n3. Q: Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque\n   A: Angular momentum is conserved when there is zero net external torque. The correct answer is (D) III only.\n\n4. Q: A photocell of work function φ = 2 eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 × 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\n   A: The question is asking for the current through the resistor, which has units of Amperes. The only answer choice with units of current is (D) 24 A, so that is the correct answer.\n\n5. Q: A pipe full of air is closed at one end. A standing wave is produced in the pipe, causing the pipe to sound a note. Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave's properties at the closed end of the pipe?\n   A: At the closed end of the pipe, the particle displacement is at a node (zero displacement), but the pressure is at an antinode (maximum pressure). The correct answer is (B) The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node.\n\n6. Q: A light bulb rated at 100 W is twice as bright as a bulb rated at 50 W when both are connected in parallel directly to a 100-V source. Now imagine that these bulbs are instead connected in series with each other. Which is brighter, and by how much?\n   A: When connected in series, the current through both bulbs is the same. Since the 100-W bulb has twice the resistance of the 50-W bulb, it will have twice the voltage drop across it and thus be twice as bright. The correct answer is (B) The 100-W bulb is twice as bright."
